Q5
x(t,u) = a*cos(t*2pi)*sin(u*2pi)
y(t,u) = b*sin(t*2pi)*sin(u*2pi)
z(t,u) = c*cos(u*2pi)

b) cross section
two points on the intersection are the normals, not at an arbitrary point of t
and u, they have to be those specific points of t and u

Q3 vanishing point
limit u1, u2 -> infinity, u1,u2 for l1,l2
